# Retail Price Recommendation
In this machine learning project, we will build a model that automatically suggests the right product prices. 
We are provided of the following information:

train_id — the id of the listing

name — the title of the listing

item_condition_id — the condition of the items provided by the sellers

category_name — category of the listing

brand_name — the name of the brand

price — the price that the item was sold for. This is target variable that we will predict

shipping — 1 if shipping fee is paid by seller and 0 by buyer

item_description — the full description of the item
